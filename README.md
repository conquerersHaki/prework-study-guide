# prework-study-guide

## a study guide for course prework


    ## DESCRIPTION
        What motivated me to build this little web application is expanding on my current knowledge and being able to apply what I have previously learned to a much more "real world scenario." I wanted to build this project because I knew I could accomplish it with what I've learned and it was a stepping stone to be able to know what to work on in the future and where I can improve. It will offer up a random topic to study and there are bullet points on some of the important topics from the lesson. I was able to learn how to apply my JavaScript syntax knowledge to an HTML and CSS file and be able to build a whole study guide web page, albeit a small one. I can't wait to work on more.



    ## INSTALLATION
        There are a multitude of applications installed in order to get your development envirenment up and running. GitBash is an application that is connected to your GitHub repositories (or repos for short). It provides navigation through your computer's directory in order to access specific files and work on them. 

        Visual Studio Code is the application to use when you want to alter your code without altering the original file. Once you've made your changes, you can then push those changes into your GitHub repo using GitBash which will then send this new information to GitHub where you can choose to finalize these edits and add them to your original code.

        Lastly, the only other application needed to bring this project together was simply a web browser in order to view your progress from VSC and to access the source code and the console where your JavaScropt functions work their magic.

    ## USAGE
        This webpage can be used to review study material for each topic listed. To use one of the webpage's most exciting features, simply right click an empty space on your browser screen--this will bring up a list of options. Click 'inspect' and there you can view all of the code provided in order to make this web application. Click the 'console' button to be able to view the randomizer that decides for you via a randomizer which topic to study. Each time you refresh, this provides a new, random selection from the list of topics in the webpage!

    ## CREDITS
        Most, if not all, of the code itself is offered by The UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. Module 3 of the prework section provided step by step assistance in building this web application.
